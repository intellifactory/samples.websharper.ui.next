# WebSharper.UI [![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/scmqf68re8otea8h)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/Jand42/websharper-ui-next)

This is the source for the [samples
website](http://intellifactory.github.io/websharper.ui.next.samples) for
the
[WebSharper.UI](http://www.github.com/dotnet-websharper/ui)
reactive frontend system. The aim of the library is to allow the
creation of dynamic, reactive single-page applications in an intuitive
manner.

The in-depth description of the library and the documentation pages have
moved to the main UI repository
[here](http://www.github.com/dotnet-websharper/ui).

The site is itself written in UI, and demonstrates all features of
the library.
