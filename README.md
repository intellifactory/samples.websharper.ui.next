# WebSharper.UI [![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/n8uco25vdshc2lae?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/IntelliFactory/websharper-ui-next-samples)

This is the source for the [samples
website](http://websharper-samples.github.io/ui) for
the
[WebSharper.UI](http://www.github.com/dotnet-websharper/ui)
reactive frontend system. The aim of the library is to allow the
creation of dynamic, reactive single-page applications in an intuitive
manner.

The in-depth description of the library and the documentation pages have
moved to the main UI repository
[here](http://www.github.com/dotnet-websharper/ui).

The site is itself written in UI, and demonstrates all features of
the library.
